## This is a chatbot that uses Large Language Models to function, similar to ChatGPT, Gemini, and Bard
This is done by making use of open-source models through HuggingFace's API


llm.py makes use of depreciated functions and methods

llm2.py makes use of updated functions and methods making use of pipelines and tokenizer published in HuggingFace's documentation

To run the model, run the command [!pip install requirements.txt] in the console
Afterwhich, enter the command "chainlit run llm.py" or "chainlit run llm2.py"

Model used can be substituted by similar models (text generation)
